# Patterns

​	***Patterns*** refers to the spatial distribution characteristic of SVG (spatially variable genes). In this tab we show our analysis results of genes with a pattern and others genes that with a similar pattern to that gene.

​	All the genes with pattern can be selected from by `Genes with pattern ` drop-down box. And then other genes with a similar pattern to selected gene are listed below in a table. Clicking on a gene name will plot gene expression in the right drawing area.
