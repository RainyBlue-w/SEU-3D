# Plot feature (Series)

​	In this tab you could plot series of genes at a time, like:

​	On the left is a figure of the genes' expression on flatten coordinate, and on the right is the ***proportion of cell types*** of cells with gene expression.

​	There are two ways to tell the server which genes need to be plotted. 

1. `Contains`  input box

   ​	There are many genes with similar functions that share the same prefix, you could type in the prefix into the `Contains` input box and plot these genes. 

   > Text below the input box shows will how many genes will be drawn. Please don't draw too many genes at once.

2. `Name list` text area

   Or you can put all the genes you want to plot into the `Name list` text area, which can be separated by Spaces, line breaks, commas, etc.
