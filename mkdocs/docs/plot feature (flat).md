​	In this tab the digital embryos are displayed by ***flatten coordinate***, which is converted from three-dimensional coordinates by:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
x' = \left\{
\begin{array}{**rcl**}
-\theta\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)}&,x<0 \\
\theta\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)} &,x>0 \\
\end{array}
\right. \\
~\\
y' = z
\end{array}
$$
​	In the drop-down box on the left, you can select the time point and gene you are interested in to view.
