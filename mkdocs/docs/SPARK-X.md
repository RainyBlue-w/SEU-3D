# SPARK-X

​	In this tab, we show all the SVG (spatially variable genes) calculated using [SPARK-X](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02404-0) in several tables.

​	There are 4 columns in the tables: `ecto p.adj`, `meso p.adj`, `endo p.adj`, `all p.adj`. The first three are calculated separately from the three germ layers of the embryo, and the last is calculated using the entire embryo. 

​	The tables are sorted by `all p.adj` by default, you could also do sorting and filtering by yourself.
